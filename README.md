Preprossing images with focus on segmentation of CT slices. The work coincides with COV19D competetion, the 2nd round.

### Region based segmentation using annotated public "COVID-19 CT segmentation dataset"

* The algorithm explores lung region based segmetnation.
* The dice coeffecient was used to measure the preformance of the segmetnation method.
* The annotated CT images at http://medicalsegmentation.com/covid19/ was used.
* From the annotated dataset: the Image volumes (308 Mb), and the Lung masks (1 Mb) were used to validate the segmentaiton performacne.
